# CVE-2022-22965 Spring Core Vulnerability

A recently discovered vulnerability in the Spring 
([CVE-2022-22965](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-22965)) has been reported as 
affecting systems running Java 9+. **Note** systems using Java 8 are not thought to be vulnerable at this 
time.

As far as we can determine at this time while GeoServer does use a potentially vulnerable version of the 
library but we do not think it is exploitable via GeoServer.

The GeoServer team are aware of the reports of this vulnerability, so please do not contact us asking about it 
unless you are reporting an actual demonstration of the problem in a GeoServer installation or are offering to 
assist in the upgrade process with developer time or money.

We are working on upgrading to a patched version of the library and will post an update when that work is 
complete.
